This repository contains five projects related to *Fintech* course in Politecnico di Milano. Financial technology (Fintech) is the introduction of new technologies and innovations in the traditional financial methods and services. Within the financial services industry, some of the used technologies include machine learning. The aim of the course is to show use cases where these techniques are applied to specific financial problems, overcoming traditional methods.
