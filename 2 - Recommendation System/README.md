# Needs-based recommendation system

Several supervised learning techniques (e.g. logistic regression) are tested in order to successfully classify clients data from a bank. The dataset `Needs.xls` contains $5000$ samples related to as many clients. A total of $7$ features (excluding the <code>ID</code> column) describe the clients. The last two columns, <code>IncomeInvestment</code> and <code>AccumulationInvestment</code>, are the two labels. Two different classifiers are built for the two labels. Then, a very simple recommendation system is built upon classifiers predictions. This recommendation system assigns a specific product (e.g. balanced mutual fund, fixed income mutual fund, ...) to each client, according to their own income/accumulation investments propensity and risk propensity.
